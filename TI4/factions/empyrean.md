## F.A.Q.
Q: When a player gives you their commodities and triggers Dark Pact, do you gain all the trade goods simultaneously or the Dark Pact TG separately? (For the purposes of Pillage)  
A: It is a single gain of commodities and 1 TG simultaneously.

Q: Can the Empyrean flagship be used to repair the same ship, multiple times in the same combat round? Can it spend a 4 influence planet to use the ability twice?  
A: The Dynamoâ€™s ability can be used multiple times in the same combat round by spending 2 influence, individually, each time. However, the same unit could not use its Sustain Damage ability multiple times during the same timing window.
