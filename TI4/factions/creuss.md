### QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT
You treat all systems that contain either an alpha or beta wormhole as adjacent to each other. Game effects cannot prevent you from using this ability.

## F.A.Q.
Q: Can the Creuss Promissory note still be used if the Creuss have not researched “Wormhole Generator”?  
A: Yes, the promissory note does not require that the “Wormhole Generator” technology have been researched.

Q: Can the “Light/Wave Deflector” technology be used to move through a wormhole created by the Ghosts of Creuss’ “Hil Colish” flagship?  
A: Yes, “Light/Wave Deflector” would allow a player other than the Ghosts of Creuss to move their fleet through the “Hil Colish’s” system into Creuss system or the Creuss Gate system.

Q: If the “Hil Colish” moves before other ships and is returned to reinforcements by a gravity rift, can other ships still use its delta wormhole to reach the active system?  
A: No, the wormhole ceases to exist when the “Hil Colish” is returned to reinforcements.

Q: If there is an ‘A’ wormhole on Mecatol Rex when the “Ixthian Artifact” agenda causes units in adjacent systems to be destroyed, does the "Quantum Entanglement" ability cause the Ghost of Creuss faction to lose units in a system that contains a ‘B’ wormhole?  
A: No. Only the Creuss treats those systems as adjacent.


Q: When multiple ships with capacity move through wormholes, how many fighters are placed with the Ghosts Commander, Sai Seravus?  
A: When Sai Seravus is used, fighters are placed in the active system one at a time, up to the number of ships with capacity that moved through wormholes, or the capacity limit in the system is reached, whichever happens first.

Q: How does the Ghosts of Creuss Hero, Singularity Reactor, interact with tokens (e.g. wormholes, Mirage)?  
A: All tokens stay with their original tile.
