5. Bake in a preheated 325Â° oven for 1 hour.
6. Remove garlic and let it cool until you can handle it.
7. Combine water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a medium saucepan over medium/high heat.

9. Squeeze the sides of the head of garlic until the pasty roasted garlic  is squeezed out.
10. Discard remaining skin and whisk to combine.
11. Add remaining ingredients to the pan and stir.
12. Let mixture simmer for 40-50 minutes or until sauce has reduced by about 1/2 and is thick and syrupy. Make sure it doesn't boil over.
