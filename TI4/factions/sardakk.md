## F.A.Q.
Q: Does a Ceasefire promissory note have any impact on committing ground forces from adjacent planets via Sardakk N’orr’s commander, G’hom Sek’kus?  
A: Will change “commit ground forces” in LRR to say “move” to ensure Ceasefire works. Will also prevent units from being committed to planets in anomalies without the appropriate technology, or through wormholes if Enforced Travel Ban is a Law.

Q: Can the Sardakk N’orr player commit ground forces via their commander, G’hom Sek’kus, on defense?  
A: No, only the active player can commit ground forces.

Q: Does using Dominus Orb allow the Sardakk N’orr player to commit ground forces via their commander, G’hom Sek’kus?  
A: No, G’hom Sek’kus is explicitly preventing committing from systems with tokens, and Dominus Orb is purged several steps before committing takes place.

Q: Can Sardakk N’orr’s commander, G’hom Sek’kus, be used without moving any ships into the active system?  
A: Yes, the commander can allow the Sardakk N’orr player to commit ground forces even without moving in ships.

Q: Does Valkyrie Particle Weave trigger after hits were produced if the hits were cancelled?  
A: Yes, the hit from Valkyrie Particle Weave is still applied. 

Q: Does the Sardakk N'orr Exotrireme 2's ability ignores the Sustain Damage ability ?  
A: Yes, as the words of the ability says "Destroy up to 2 ships" and not "Produce 2 hits".

Q: Who choses the targets of the Exotrireme II's ability?  
A: The Sardakk N'orr Player chooses the targets.
