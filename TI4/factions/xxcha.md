## F.A.Q.

A: Yes, a planet is considered to be adjacent to its own system.

Q: Can the Xxcha use the “Peace Accords” faction ability on a planet that has another players ships in the space area of the system?  
A: Yes, as long as the planet being targeted is free of opposing players units (Ground Forces & Structures).

Q: Can the Xxcha promissory note "Political Favor" be used if the Xxcha players strategy pool doesn't have any Command Tokens in it?  
A: No, the strategy token discard is mandatory and must resolve for the rest of the card effect to work.

A: Yes, "Instinct Training" can be used to cancel the effect of a "Sabotage".

Q: Can the Xxcha Agent, Ggrocuto Rinn, be used to “ready” a planet that is not exhausted?  
A: The target planet must be exhausted.

Q: If the Xxcha hero (Xxekir Grom) gives two players in the lead a Victory Point, and both players now have enough points to win the game, is the order for winning determined from Xxcha player (active player) onwards in initiative, or starting with the lowest initiatve?  
A: Initiative order determines the winner. Initiative order is always the lowest initiative player onwards, regardless of who the active player is.

Q: Can the Xxcha Kingdom player play riders while using their hero, Xxekir Grom? Can other players use riders during the Xxcha hero?  
A: Yes, the Xxcha player can play riders, and use their quash ability during their hero (other players do not vote, even if quashed). Other players cannot play any action cards as these are abilities.

Q: If Xxcha draws Covert legislation as one of their 5 Agendas with their hero, do they get to see the next agenda that would be tied to it as well? Related, what happens if they draw an agenda that says "if there are no laws in play..." off of their hero?  
A: Xxcha would only get to see the agenda tied to Covert Legislation if it was one of the 2 agendas selected to resolve and they are the speaker, otherwise the speaker would see the agenda. If there are no laws in play a new agenda is drawn

Q: When using the Xxcha Kingdom Hero Xxekir Grom, can other players resolve agendas that affect the whole table, such as Galactic Crisis Pact?  
A: The intent is that players still resolve agendas that the Xxcha player chooses off of their Hero. I recognize that this may conflict with RAW, but the intention was never to make other players unable to resolve agenda effects. 

Q: Checks and balances against reads “Each player readies only 3 of their planets at the end of this agenda phase.” Does this trigger at the end of Xxchas hero? At the end of the next agenda phase, not at all?  
A: This effect does not trigger if it happens during the Xxcha Hero.

Q: When the Xxcha Kingdom hero, Political Data Nexus Omega, is used do they get both resources and influence, or is it only one?  
A: When the Xxcha Kingdom hero, Political Data Nexus Omega, is used to combine resource and influence values, the Xxcha Kingdom player chooses to spend those as one or the other, not both.

Q: For the Xxcha Kingdom hero, Political Data Nexus Omega, unlock condition; what is the order of scoring public and secret objectives? Can the hero be unlocked in between these?  
A: Scoring in the status phase is done all at once, the unlock condition of heroes is not checked until the score objectives step of the status phase is complete.

Q: If the Xxcha Kingdom plays uprising with Political Data Nexus Omega unlocked do they get the sum of both influence and resources in trade goods?  
A: When using an ability that references “resource value”, the printed resource value of the planet is used.
