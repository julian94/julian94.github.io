## F.A.Q.
Q: How does the Agenda "Publicize Weapon Schematics" affect the Embers of Muaat's War Suns?  
A: Prototype War Sun I is considered a war sun but is a printed unit not a war sun technology. Thus, a vote of "For" would mean that it would lose the Sustain Damage ability but other players would not be able to ignore war sun prerequisites. A vote of "Against" would not affect the Muaat player. The agenda plays as normal if the Muaat player has researched Prototype War Sun II.

Q: How does The Embers of Muaat Hero, Nova Seed, interact with tokens (e.g. wormholes, Mirage)?  
A: Nova Seed also purges all tokens other than command tokens and frontier tokens. Any faction specific tokens are returned to that faction.
