## F.A.Q.
Q: Can the Naaz-Rohka hero, Hesh and Prit, be used when the player has no tokens in reinforcements?  
A: The LRR will be updated to be more general towards taking off sheet if none are in reinforcements. This change should cover other requirements in this regard as well.

Q: Can you purge a relic fragment to gain a command token if you have no command tokens in your reinforcements?  
A: Yes, you can purge the fragment and not gain a command token if there are none in reinforcements.

Q: For the Naaz-Rokha’s Distant Suns ability, do you decide to draw the extra exploration card before you draw the first card, or after?  
A: Before the initial exploration card is drawn.

Q: Does the Mech “Z Grav Eidolon” count against fleet supply?  
A: No, because this unit is also transported.
