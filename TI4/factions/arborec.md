## F.A.Q.
Q: Can the Arborec's "Mitosis" ability be used to place 1 infantry on every planet they control?  
A: No. Only 1 infantry may be placed on a single planet using this ability.

Q: Can the secondary ability of the “Warfare” strategy card be used to trigger the “Production” ability of the Arborec’s Letani Warriors?  
A: No, the “Warfare” secondary ability can only be used to trigger the production ability of space docks, and thus cannot be used by the Arborec to produce additional infantry.

Q: Can the “Production” abilities of multiple Arborec “Letani Warriors” in a system be combined to allow the production of two infantry for one resource?  
A: Yes. Production value is totaled when the “Production” ability of units in a system is used.

Q: Does the Arborec flagship (The “Duha Menaimon”) need to be in a system when it is activated to make use of its ability?  
A: Yes. The “Duha Menaimon” can only be used to produce units when it is in a system at the moment it is activated.

Q: Can the technology "Sarween Tools" be used to reduce the cost of units produced by the Duha Menaimon?  
A: No. Sarween tools can only be used when a unit specifically uses the PRODUCTION ability

Q: When using the Arborec's hero ability "Ultrasonic Emitter", does the cost for the produced units need to be paid for?  
A: Yes. Any game effect that instructs a player to produce units requires them to pay for them unless otherwise specified.
