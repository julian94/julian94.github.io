## F.A.Q.
Q: When the Universities of Jol-Nar player uses their hero, Rin, do they swap all techs simultaneously or consecutively?  
A: Simultaneously, that is to say the Universities of Jol-Nar player cannot swap out a tech and re-take it during this component action.

Q: If the Universities of Jol-Nar player replaces a faction technology with their hero, what happens if the Nekro Virus player had a Valefar Assimilator token on it?  
A: The token stays on the tech in the tech-deck and Valefar Assimilator still has that technologyâ€™s text.
