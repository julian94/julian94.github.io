## F.A.Q.
Q: Does the Yin Brotherhood agent, Brother Milor, keep combat going after the last ship is destroyed?  
A: Yes.

Q: Can the Yin Brotherhood commander, Brother Omar, or the Naalu Collective commander, M’aban, allow the player to choose to produce only 1 infantry/fighter and then another with their commander?  
A: Yes, both of these commanders allow the player to choose to only build a single fighter/infantry for 1 resource and gain an additional unit of that type each time they do.

Q: Does a destroyer use its anti-fighter barrage ability before it is destroyed by the Impulse core technology?  
A: No. "Start of Combat" abilities occur before the Anti-fighter barrage step.

Q: The Yin Brotherhood hero, Quantum Dissemination Omega, says to "resolve invasions" on those planets. Does this allow for using Parley, committing additional ground forces, and using bombardment? Should this be ground combats?  
A: The Yin hero, Quantum Dissemination Omega, should indicate to resolve ground combats on those planets, not full invasion steps. Parley can be played on one of the planets.

Q: Can the Yin Brotherhood Agent, Brother Milor Omega, be used during the Agenda Phase?  
A: Brother Milor Omega can only be used during the action phase.

Q: What is the interaction between the Yin Brotherhood agent, Brother Milor Omega, and the Nekro Virus and Naalu Collective flagship abilities?  
A: The units participating in combat via these flagship abilities are both a ground force and ship during combat. The owner of the unit can choose whether to place 2 infantry or 2 fighters when using Brother Milor Omega, however units placed this way can only continue to participate in space combat if fighters are placed, and can only continue to participate in ground combat if infantry are placed.
