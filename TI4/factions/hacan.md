## F.A.Q.
Q: Does the Hacan player have to initiate negotiations in order to transact with a player who is not their neighbor?  
A: So long as the active player is involved in the transaction, either player may suggest the opening of negotiations, on either player’s turn.

Q: Can Hacan trade action cards after having Political Secret played against them?  
A: Arbiters is a passive ability and the Emirates of Hacan can trade Action cards regardless of having their Political Secret played against them.

Q: What happens if the Emirates of Hacan trade a planet during combat using their mech’s ability? Particularly when combined with Integrated Economy or the Nomad faction technology Temporal Command Suite?  
A: A planet that has the Hacan Mech can’t be traded in combat. You can’t produce ground forces on a planet with another player’s ground forces. Future errata will clarify this.

Q: Can I use the Nekro Virus’ Agent, Nekro Malleon, or Psychoarchaeology or the Hacan Agent to interrupt another ability since the timing is “during the action phase”?  
A: No, any ability that is used “during the action phase” cannot be resolved unless there are no other abilities currently being resolved.
