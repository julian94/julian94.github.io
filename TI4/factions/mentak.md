After 1 of your neighbors gains trade goods or resolves a transaction, if they have 3 or more trade goods, you may take 1 of their trade goods or commodities.

## Promissory Note
### Promise of Protection  
Action: Place this card face-up in your play area.  
While this card is in your play area, the Mentak player cannot use their Pillage faction ability against you.  
If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Mentak player's units, return this card to the Mentak player.  

## Faction Technologies

## F.A.Q.
Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Salvage Operations” faction-specific technology to produce infantry after a combat against the Nekro Virus flagship “The Alastor” in which Nekro Virus infantry were treated like ships and were subsequently destroyed?  
A: No, the infantry do not count as ships once the combat is over.

Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Pillage” faction ability to steal trade goods when they are neighbors with another faction as a result of the “Lazax Gate Folding” faction technology or “Quantum Entanglement” faction ability?  
A: Yes, even in the case of “Quantum Entanglement” only being active from the Creuss’ point of view, because the ‘neighbor’ status is active as a result of the ability, the Mentak may use their “Pillage” in these situations.

Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Pillage” faction ability for each time the Saar gain a trade good from the “Scavenge” faction ability in a single turn, provided that the other requirements are met?  
A: Yes. The Mentak can trigger “Pillage” each time the Saar gain control of a planet, if all the conditions of “Pillage” are met.

Q: If Ipswitch, Loose Cannon is used in a space combat where both the Fourth Moon and the Van Hauge is present and the latter is destroyed, leading to the destruction of all other ships in the system, does the Mentak player regain their flagship as well as any other ships of the same (legal) sort that the Yin player lost, or just the ships that were available from the reinforcements before the combat?  
A: Yes

Q: Can the Mentak Coalition’s hero, Sleeper Cell, be used to place a warsun if you do not own the warsun technology?  
A: No.

Q: If Mentak's Hero, Sleeper Cell, is used and their last ship is destroyed during a round of combat in which they also destroy an opponent's ship, does combat continue?  
A: Yes, after both players assign hits the Mentak player then places a ship from their reinforcements in the active system and combat continues.

Q: If you use the Mentak Coalition’s Hero, Ipswitch, Loose Cannon, and lose your flagship in a combat, but destroy the other player’s flagship and rebuild your own, can you score Unveil Flagship?  
A: No, the wording on Unveil Flagship would prevent you from scoring it since your flagship was destroyed in the combat, regardless of the fact that it returned.
