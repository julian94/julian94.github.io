When you win a combat, place 1 command token from your opponent's reinforcements in your fleet pool if it does not already contain 1 of that player's tokens; other player's tokens in your fleet pool increase your fleet limit but cannot be redistributed.

### IMPERIA
While another player's command token is in your fleet pool, you can use the ability of that player's commander, if it is unlocked.

Choose 1 non-home system that contains your units; each other player who has a token on the Mahact player's command sheet places a token from their reinforcements in that system.  
Then, return this card to the Mahact player.

## F.A.Q.
Q: Can you use the Mahact Agent, Jae Mir Kan, to place a token using the secondary of the Construction Strategy Card without placing a structure?  
A: The system that you place a token in must have an eligible planet for you to put a structure on.

Q: If the Mahact player has a token where they want to place a structure using another player's token, does the other player's token go in the system or to their reinforcements?  
A: The other players token is still placed in the system.


Q: In regards to the Mahact Commander, Il Na Viroset, when does your turn end? Do you resolve when/after you activate a system abilities? Is this different from Nullification Field or Starlancer? Can you resolve end of your turn abilities?  
A: Contrary to a previous Twitter ruling, when/after you activate and other abilities within your turn cannot be used when the Mahact player places a second token in a system. End of turn abilities can still be used. Any ability that ends your turn should be treated as ending your turn when they occur, and no further abilities during that same trigger window can take place.

Q: What's the interaction with the Mahact Commander, Il Na Viroset, and the Counterstroke action card?  
A: Counterstroke cannot be played.

Q: Does Dark Energy Tap trigger if you used the Mahact Commander, Il Na Viroset?  
A: No.

Q: Do ships roll when moving out of a gravity rift due to the Mahact Hero, Benediction?  
A: Yes.

Q: When the Mahact hero, Benediction, is used who is considered the attacker and who is the defender? For ability purposes, is the combat system considered “The Active System”?  
A: The ships being moved belong to the "attacker" and the ships not being moved belong to the "defender.” The combat system is treated as the active system during that combat.

Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, is capacity resolved after moving ships before the space combat? (Only relevant if moving fighters away from a space dock)?  
A: A Capacity check is resolved before the space combat begins.

Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, can the Mahact player transport other players' ground forces from planets? Can the units’ owner transport ground forces from planets?  
A: No in both circumstances.

Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, can the Mahact player transport their own ground forces from planets when moving?  
A: Yes.

Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, if another player's fleet is moved into a Mahact fleet, who is the attacker/defender?  
A: The player that is moved is the attacker, the player that is moved into is the defender.

Q: Can Mahact use their mech ability on themselves?  
A: Yes.

Q: If you are the Mahact player, what happens when an agenda tells you to “remove one of your command tokens from your fleet pool and return it to your reinforcements” but you only have tokens from other players in your fleet pool?  
A: You are required to remove another player’s token and return it to that player’s reinforcements.

Q: If the law Fleet Regulations is in play, and Mahact already has 4 tokens in fleet, can they add another one and then discard one via Edict, or can they NOT add one after a combat win because of the “cannot” in Fleet Regulations?  
A: The Mahact player can add a 5th token and choose one to return to their reinforcements from their fleet pool afterward.

Q: Can a player with 0 votes be targeted by Genetic Recombination? It is theoretically possible for someone to receive abilities via transaction to allow them to vote after the timing window of Genetic Recombination. Is there a defined difference between “cannot vote” and “currently has no votes” for the purposes of this technology?  
A: Genetic Recombination happens before a player would exhaust planets to vote. So if a player cannot vote, or does not have votes to cast, they cannot be targeted by the tech. If they obtain an ability that would allow them to vote, they could be targeted by the tech before the votes are cast.

Q: If Mahact has an Arborec Command Token in their fleet pool, after another player activates an appropriate system that does not already contain a Mahact Mech, can the Mahact player produce a mech and then trigger that mech's ability to end a player’s turn?  
A: No, the mech was not in the system at the time of activation, so it didn't see the trigger for its ability.
