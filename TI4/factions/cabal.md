### Commodities
The Vuil'Raith Cabal has a commodity limit of 2.

## Faction Abilities
### DEVOUR 
Capture your opponent's non-structure units that are destroyed during combat.

### AMALGAMATION  
When you produce a unit, you may return 1 captured unit of that type to produce that unit without spending resources.

### RIFTMELD  
When you research a unit upgrade technology, you may return 1 captured unit of that type to ignore all of the technology's prerequisites.

## Capture  
Capture is a new mechanic introduced in the Prophecy of Kings expansion.  
A player with abilities allowing capture may capture another player's unit by taking that piece and placing it on their faction sheet, where it remains until it is Returned.  
Captured units cannot be produced by their original owner until they are recovered.  
If at least one of a player’s space docks is being blockaded, they cannot capture units from the player who is blockading them. 

### Capturing and returning Non-Fighter Ships and Mechs  
If a player captures a non-fighter ship or mech, they place it on their faction sheet.  
A captured non-fighter ship or mech can be returned, as follows:  
If the player who captured the unit agrees to return it as part of a transaction  
If an ability allows a player to return a captured ship, typically as a cost for an effect  
When such a unit is returned, it is placed in the reinforcements of the player who it was captured from.  
If a player who has their units captured blockades a space dock belonging to the player that has captured their units, all of their non-fighter ships and mechs on that player's faction sheet are returned to their reinforcements.

### Capturing Fighters and Infantry  
If a player captures a fighter or infantry it is placed in its reinforcements instead of the >Capturing player's faction sheet. The capturing player then places a fighter or infantry token from the supply on their faction sheet instead.  
Captured Fighters and Infantry do not belong to any player, meaning they cannot be returned as part of a transaction or blockade. They remain on the capturing player's faction sheet until an ability returns them, at which point they are placed in the supply

## Promissory Note
### Crucible  
After you activate a system:  
Your ships do not roll for gravity rifts during this movement; apply an additional +1 to the move values of your ships that would move out of or through a gravity rift instead.  
Then, return this card to the Vuil'raith player. 

## Faction Technologies

## F.A.Q.
Q: Can Vortex be used on a ship if a player doesn't have any of those ships in their reinforcements?  
A: No, since they cannot fully resolve Vortex.

Q: Are systems that contain Vuil’raith Cabal’s Dimensional Tears anomalies?  
A: Yes, any game effect that references an anomaly includes systems containing Dimensional Tears.

Q: Can the Vuil’raith Cabal use their agent on someone who has their Trade Agreement used to take their commodities?  
A: Yes, the commodities would not be there but the agent could still be used to capture a ship up to the player’s commodity value.

Q: Does the Cabal Flagship capture other units that are destroyed in the same timing window in which it is destroyed?  
A: Yes.

Q: What happens to captured units when the owner is eliminated?  
A: Captured units remain on the sheet of the player that captured them. If they would ever be returned to the eliminated player, they are returned to the game box instead

Q: Can a ship benefit from the Vuil'raith Cabal promissory note, The Crucible, if it would not be able to reach a gravity rift on the way to the active system without it?  
A: Yes, once a system has been activated and The Crucible has been played, the bonus would apply to all ships that can make it to the active system, including the bonuses from the promissory and the rift they are passing through.

Q: Does Cabal Agent count as "converting your own commodities," or is the Cabal player converting them for the purpose of Pillage?  
A: No, whenever commodities are converted to a player’s own trade good area, they are not considered gained.
