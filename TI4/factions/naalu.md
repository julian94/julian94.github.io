## F.A.Q.
Q: Does the Naalu flagship (“The Matriarch”) allow the Naalu to take gain control of a planet using only fighters?  
A: No. The Naalu fighters return to the space area when ground combat ends. If no Naalu ground forces are present, the combat is considered to be a draw, and the Naalu do not gain control of the planet during the “Establish Control” step.

Q: Using the Naalu flagship (“The Matriarch”) in combination with the “Dacxive Animators” technology, can the Naalu gain control of a planet using only fighters?  
A: No, as you cannot win (only draw) ground combat with only Naalu fighters (see above question). However, if you could somehow win, the exact sequence of events if you win the ground combat would be to place an infantry with Daxcive Animators, return the fighters to the space area, then take control of the planet during the "Establish Control" step.

Q: Does the Naalu “0” token move with the strategy card it is placed on if the card is exchanged with or taken by another player?  
A: No. The Naalu “0” token stays with the Naalu or the faction that gained the token through the “Gift of Prescience” promissory note and is placed on any of that player’s strategy cards.

Q: Can the Naalu Collective commander, M’aban, or the Yin Brotherhood commander, Brother Omar, allow the player to choose to produce only 1 infantry/fighter and then another with their commander?  
A: Yes, both of these commanders allow the player to choose to only build a single fighter/infantry for 1 resource and gain an additional unit of that type each time they do. 

Q: The Naalu Collective agent, Z’eu Omega, says "resolve a tactical action" but this is during a component action. How does this work for the Mahact Gene-Sorceres mech, Starlancer? Master Plan? Ministers of Peace and War? Who is the active player for abilities/transactions? Can Naalu use Fleet Logistics after this action? Can players who passed use it?  
A: The Naalu Collective agent, Z’eu Omega is a component action that allows a player to take a tactical action and effectively makes them the active player for the duration of the tactical action (and any actions that may occur after, due to further abilities causing further actions). This DOES NOT count as the tactical action player’s turn, so they cannot utilize fleet logistics, however they could use Master Plan or the Minister of War, as these reference tactical actions and not a player’s turn. Minister of Peace and the Mahact Gene-Sorcerers mech, Starlancer ends the turn of the tactical action player, regardless of referencing a “turn”.

Q: When Covert Legislation is revealed, is there a window in which the Naalu Collective commander, M’aban Omega, can look at the next agenda card? Can they look while the Politics player is resolving the primary of that strategy card, or while putting them on the top/bottom?  
A: The Naalu Collective Commander, M’aban Omega, cannot look at the next card when Covert Legislation is revealed before the speaker draws the top card of the agenda deck. It also cannot be used to interrupt the primary ability of the Politics strategy card.


Q: When using the primary ability of diplomacy on a system that has Naalu ships, does this activate the ability of Neuroglaive and force all players to place a token from their fleet pool into their reinforcements?  
A: No. That system is not activated by the use of the "Diplomacy" strategy card.
