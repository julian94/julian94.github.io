Note: The “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step can occur even if a player’s opponent has no fighters in the combat (in this case all hits produced from Anti-Fighter Barrage may cause opposing ships with Sustain Damage to become damaged)

## F.A.Q.
Q: Can ships damaged by Raid Formation trigger a window for the Direct Hit Action card?  
A: No, Raid Formation does not cause the ship to use its Sustain Damage ability, it only causes it to become damaged, so there is no window for Direct Hit to be used.


Q: Can the Argent Flight Hero "Mirik Aun Sissiri" be used to move ships into a Supernova or Nebula tile?  
A: No. Any units moving into, through or out of anomalies must follow the same rules for ships moving into, through or out of anomalies.


Q: When is Raid Formation applied? After rolling or after assigning hits? (Interacts with Waylay)  
A: Raid formation is applied after rolling, before canceling or assigning hits.


Q: Does Strike Wing Alpha II infantry killing get prevented by Shields Holding/re-roll abilities?  
A: The rolls from Strike Wing Alpha II can be subject to rerolls before the ability is applied, but the infantry would be destroyed BEFORE any cancellation of hits.
