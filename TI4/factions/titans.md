## F.A.Q.
Q: Hel Titans cannot be transported but can they be moved by use of the technology Transit Diodes?  
A: Since Transit Diodes uses the terms "remove" and "place" it may be used to move Hel Titans.

Q: Can Hel Titans be destroyed by Bombardment?  
A: Since Hel Titans are treated as ground forces, they may be bombarded; provided the player bombarding has a unit or ability that is capable of bypassing their Planetary Shield ability.

Q: If you awaken a sleeper token or deploy your flagship and then your turn ends (Mahact mech, Nullification field, Minister of Peace), do you resolve combat?  
A: Coalescence forces combat steps to occur. No other steps of the tactical action occur, and abilities can only be used within combat.

Q: If Titans of Ul have their commander, Tungstantus, unlocked and have 2 TGs and go to production to gain a third and build a carrier, is that TG able to be pillaged?  
A: The gain and spend are simultaneous, so cannot be pillaged.

Q: Does the Titans of Ul promissory note “Terraform” count for the purposes of objectives like “Strengthen Bonds” or “Betray a Friend”?  
A: Yes, when Terraform is attached to a planet it counts as being in that planet owner’s play area.

Q: Does 63.3 (2 PDS on a planet max) mean that Titans couldn't commit Hel-Titans using the Sardakk commander, or place a PDS via Sleeper token onto a planet where another player already has 2 PDS? Related, if a planet has 2 PDS on it already can you DEPLOY the Titan’s mech there, given that the mech is "when you would place a PDS"?  
A: 63.3 does not prevent Titans from deploying a PDS. You cannot place a structure on a planet with the maximum number of your structures, which prevents using the DEPLOY ability on a planet with 2 PDS, or placing more PDS than would be allowed using Transit Diodes. You also cannot DEPLOY a mech if you have no PDS in reinforcements, but could remove a PDS from the board and then DEPLOY your mech.

Q: If the Titans Agent is used to cancel the only hit “when” it is generated against a player that has Valkyrie Particle Weave as a technology, does VPW trigger?  
A: The Titan’s Agent will  receive an errata to have the same timing as Shields Holding or Sustain Damage. “Before you assign a hit”. The hit is still produced, VPW triggers, then the hit is canceled.

Q: Can the Titans Hel-Titan move via abilities like the action card Ghost Squad or via the Sardakk N’orr Alliance?  
A: No, structures cannot move.

Q: Does the Geoform ability of Ul the progenitor count as an attachment for the purpose of the objective "Reclaim ancient monuments"?  
A: Yes.
