### TECHNOLOGICAL SINGULARITY  
Once per combat, after 1 of your opponent's units is destroyed, you may gain 1 technology that is owned by that player.

You cannot research technology. When you would research a technology, gain 3 command tokens instead.

## Promissory Note
### Antivirus
At the start of a combat:  
Place this card face-up in your play area.      
While this card is in your play area, the Nekro player cannot use their TECHNOLOGICAL SINGULARITY faction ability against you.  
If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Nekro player's units, return this card to the Nekro player.  

## Faction Technologies
### Valefar Assimilator X  
When you would gain another player's technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place the "X" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead.  While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text.  You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.

### Valefar Assimilator Y  
When you would gain another player's technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place the "Y" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead.  While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.

## F.A.Q.
Q: Can the Nekro Virus use the “Valefar Assimilator” technologies on printed faction units such as the Embers of Muaat’s Prototype War Sun I?  
A: No, printed faction units are not technologies, and thus are ineligible targets for “Valefar Assimilator.”

Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count as ships for the purpose of card effects and fleet supply?  
A: Infantry that are participating in space combat via “The Alastor” do count as ships (in addition to their own unit type) for the purpose of card effects, but, as a unit that can be transported, they do not count against fleet supply in that system.

Q: Can infantry involved in a space combat by using the ability of “The Alastor” flagship be used in an invasion after the space combat?  
A: Yes.

Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship cease participation in combat if the Alastor is destroyed?  
A: No. Infantry that are committed to the space combat due to the effects of "The Alastor" continue to participate until the end of the combat, even if "The Alastor" is destroyed.

Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count toward the ships required to use the “Assault Cannon” technology?  
A: Yes. These infantry may be used to resolve “Assault Cannon.”

Q: Does the Winnu “Salai Sai Corian” flagship get additional dice for infantry participating in a fight due to the Nekro “Alastor” flagship?  
A: Yes. The “Salai Sai Corian” would get one additional die per infantry.

Q: Can the Nekro Virus have both a standard and a faction-specific unit upgrade of the same type?  
A: Yes. Only the faction-specific unit upgrade technology will be in effect, but should the Nekro lose the faction-specific upgrade technology that is being copied by the “Valefar Assimilator,” they would revert to the standard unit upgrade technology that was previously inactive.

Q: If the Nekro Virus owns multiple unit upgrade technologies of the same type, such as “Dreadnought II” and “Exotrireme II,” does each one count toward the “Develop Weaponry” and “Revolutionize Warfare” objectives?  
A: No. Only one upgrade of a given type counts toward those objectives.

Q: Can a player who cannot vote (such as the Nekro Virus) play "rider" action cards?  
A: Yes. The Nekro player, or a player who cannot vote due to another effect, can still play "rider" action cards.

Q: Can the Nekro Virus player play a "rider" action card along with their "Galactic threat" faction ability?  
A: Yes, the Nekro Virus may play "rider" action cards in addition to using their Galactic threat faction ability for the same agenda.

Q: Can the Nekro Virus player play the action cards "Bribery" or "Distinguished Councillor"?  
A: No. The Nekro Virus player is unable to vote and so cannot use these cards to gain votes.

Q: If the Nekro Virus' Valefar Assimilator technology is copying another player's faction technology and that player is eliminated, does the Valefar Assimilator token remain on that technology?  
A: Yes. If a player becomes eliminated and the Nekro Virus Valefar Assimilator X or Y token is on one of their faction technologies, that technology remains in play.

Q: Can the Nekro Virus score the secret objective "Adapt New Strategies"?  
A: Although Valefar Assimilators themselves do not count, once other faction technologies are copied by them, those faction technologies count for the purpose of this objective.

Q: Can the Nekro Virus player use the Prophet's Tears Relic?  
A: Yes, when the Nekro virus player uses their Propagation faction ability, they could exhaust the Relic to gain an action card. They cannot do this when they GAIN technology via their Technological Singularity faction ability. 

Q: If the Universities of Jol-Nar player replaces a faction technology with their hero, what happens if the Nekro Virus player had a Valefar Assimilator token on it?  
A: The token stays on the tech in the tech-deck and Valefar Assimilator still has that technology’s text.

Q: Can I use the Nekro Virus’ Agent, Nekro Malleon, or Psychoarchaeology or the Hacan Agent to interrupt another ability since the timing is “during the action phase”?  
A: No, any ability that is used “during the action phase” cannot be resolved unless there are no other abilities currently being resolved.

Q: Are ground forces participating in combat via the Nekro Virus’ Flagship, The Alastor, in the space area? Are they affected by Argent Flight's Strike Wing Alpha II's ability?  
A: Ground Forces participating in space combat via The Alastor do not move from their origin location. If they were on planets at the start of combat, they stay on the planet, participate in combat, and are immune to SWA2’s ability. If they started in space, they are in space and are subject to SWA2’s ability.
